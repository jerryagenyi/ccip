## Notes from PM (John)

1. **Focus on authenticity:** Don't over-promise on ML. Position as "rule-based semiotic intelligence" for MVP with ML roadmap.

2. **Narrative consistency:** Ensure all documents tell the same story: Global platform, emerging market beachhead, UK tech center.

3. **Evidence-gathering:** Every claim needs support. Case studies, testimonials, data points.

4. **Manchester story:** Emphasize ecosystem, cost, talent, government alignment.

5. **CIC signal:** Strong commitment to social impact + profit sustainability.
