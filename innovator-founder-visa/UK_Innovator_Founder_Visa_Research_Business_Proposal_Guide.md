# PART A: DETAILED RESEARCH ON UK INNOVATOR FOUNDER VISA

## A1: Overview & Strategic Purpose

The **UK Innovator Founder Visa** (formerly Innovator & Start-up visas) is a specialist immigration route designed to attract entrepreneurs with genuinely innovative, viable, and scalable business ideas to establish and grow companies in the UK.

### Strategic Advantages:
- **No fixed minimum investment requirement** (unlike the old £50,000 threshold) - flexibility based on realistic business needs
- **3-year initial grant** with unlimited extensions as long as business meets criteria
- **Accelerated settlement pathway**: Apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) after just 3 years
- **Dependants welcome**: Partners and children can accompany/join; they can work/study
- **Flexible secondary work**: Can take skilled (Level 3+) employment if it doesn't undermine primary business commitment
- **Strong ecosystem support**: Access to UK business support, Innovate UK funding, investor networks

### Who It Targets:
- Tech entrepreneurs with disruptive innovations
- Social enterprises with scalable impact models
- Deep-tech founders with IP/research backing
- Cross-border entrepreneurs expanding to UK
- Creators, digital/creative businesses with growth potential

### Core Principle:
**Genuine founders actively running the endorsed venture as their primary purpose.** The Home Office expects day-to-day involvement, measurable progress, and compliance with the endorsed business plan.

## A2: The Two-Stage Process

### **Stage 1: Endorsement (The Filter)**
Before applying for the visa, you MUST secure an **endorsement letter** from a Home Office-approved endorsing body. This is non-negotiable.

## A4: The Endorsement Assessment Criteria (The Gatekeepers)

Endorsing bodies assess applications using a **3-stage process** and evaluate across multiple dimensions:

### **Stage 1: Initial Assessment (Pre-Qualification)**
- Quick review of business concept/viability
- Background & due diligence check on founder
- Decision: Proceed to detailed evaluation or reject early

### **Stage 2: Detailed Evaluation (The Deep Dive)**
This is where most applications succeed or fail.

**They will examine:**

| Dimension | What They Assess | What They Look For |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Innovation** | Is the idea genuinely new/different? | Market research/evidence; pilot data; differentiation from competitors; patents/IP; evidence of market demand (LOIs, pre-sales, contracts) |
| **Viability** | Can this business actually work? | Realistic financial projections (3-5 years minimum); breakdown of costs/revenue assumptions; your skills/experience to deliver; access to adequate, lawful funding; clear understanding of market/risks |
| **Scalability** | Can it grow significantly? | Structured growth plan (headcount, revenue, geographic expansion); credible milestones; evidence of scalability potential (e.g., repeatable model, network effects, expansion into new markets) |
| **Founder Credibility** | Will YOU make it happen? | Relevant industry/technical experience; entrepreneurial track record; clear roles if co-founders; evidence of commitment (own capital invested); communication of vision |
| **Lawful Funding** | Where's the money coming from? | Bank statements showing fund sources; no suspicious/illegal origin; realistic deployment plan in UK; contingency if delayed |
| **Fit with Body Focus** | Right endorser for your idea? | Does your sector/business model align with the body's expertise/focus? (e.g., tech bodies favor hard tech; some specialize in fintech) |

### **Stage 3: Decision (Endorsement Letter or Rejection)**
- If approved: Endorsement letter valid for **3 months** from issue
- Letter includes: Body name, reference number, confirmation of criteria met, commitment to monitor
- If rejected: Feedback provided; reapplication possible elsewhere or with refined plan

## A5: Common Refusal Reasons (Learn From These)

**Critical Failures:**
1. **Generic/Non-Innovative Ideas**
   - Copying existing business model with no differentiation
   - "Another freelance platform," "yet another SaaS tool"
   - **Fix:** Prove unique value prop, market evidence, competitive moat

2. **Weak Financial Evidence**
   - Vague funding plans; unclear how business will be capitalized
   - Projections with no logic/breakdown; unrealistic growth claims
   - No proof of access to funds or evidence of lawful origin
   - **Fix:** Bank statements, detailed P&L models, clear spending plan, fund transfer timeline

3. **Applicant Credibility Gaps**
   - No relevant experience or track record
   - No prior entrepreneurial success
   - Plan developed by consultant; founder's role unclear
   - **Fix:** Highlight your expertise, past wins, hands-on involvement in plan

4. **Market Evidence Lacking**
   - No customer validation (LOIs, pre-sales, beta users)
   - No market research or competitive analysis
   - Claims of demand without proof
   - **Fix:** Pilot data, signed LOIs, survey results, customer interviews

5. **Unrealistic Scaling**
   - No clear path to job creation/growth
   - "We'll dominate global market in 2 years" without evidence
   - No structured milestones or achievable targets
   - **Fix:** Realistic 3-5 year plan with measurable KPIs, phased expansion

6. **Inconsistent/Poor Documentation**
   - Documents contradict each other (different financials in business plan vs. application)
   - Typos, poor English, amateurish presentation
   - Missing supporting evidence
   - **Fix:** Professional review; proofread; include all requested docs; clarity matters

# PART B: KEY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA & WHAT ENDORSERS LOOK FOR

## B1: The Four Pillars Endorsers Evaluate

### **Pillar 1: INNOVATION (The "Wow" Factor)**

**Definition:** Business introduces something new to the market or significantly improves existing solutions. Not a franchise, reselling arrangement, or lifestyle business.

**Endorsers Ask:**
- ✓ What problem does this solve that no one else is solving (or solving badly)?
- ✓ Is there evidence of customer/market demand?
- ✓ Do you have IP, patents, or proprietary methods protecting your advantage?
- ✓ Have you validated this with pilots, MVPs, or customer feedback?
- ✓ How defensible is your competitive position?

**Evidence That Wins:**
- Patent filings or trade secrets
- Market research reports (3rd-party or commissioned)
- Customer interviews/surveys showing demand
- Pilot data or MVP results
- Letters of intent (LOIs) from potential customers
- Competitive analysis showing your unique angle
- Pre-sales or revenue from early customers
- Media coverage/thought leadership showing market awareness

**Red Flags:**
- "We'll be the Uber/Airbnb of X" (vague, generic)
- No customer validation
- "There's no direct competitor" (suggests no market)
- Relying solely on your opinion that it's innovative
- Me-too product with no differentiation

### **Pillar 2: VIABILITY (The "Realism" Test)**

**Definition:** Business plan is workable, grounded in reality, with credible execution path. Applicant has skills/experience/resources to deliver.

**Endorsers Ask:**
- ✓ Are the financial projections realistic and detailed?
- ✓ Do you understand the market, pricing, unit economics?
- ✓ Can you actually execute? (Track record, team strength, skills match)
- ✓ Do you have or can access adequate funding?
- ✓ Have you considered operational/legal/compliance requirements?

**Evidence That Wins:**
- Detailed P&L with assumptions clearly stated (not just revenue numbers)
- Cash flow projections showing runway/profitability timeline
- Breakdown of product development, marketing, operational costs
- Clear unit economics (cost per customer, lifetime value, payback period)
- Regulatory/compliance roadmap (data protection, licenses, tax planning)
- Management team bios showing relevant experience
- Contracts/partnerships confirming key assumptions
- Financial modeling tools used (not napkin math)
- Conservative revenue forecasts (showing you understand risk)

**Red Flags:**
- "We'll be profitable in 6 months" with no cost breakdown
- Financial projections that don't add up
- No understanding of unit economics or customer acquisition cost
- Team weak in critical areas (e.g., technical founder with no tech co-founder)
- No contingency plan if funding delayed or market slower than expected
- Unclear on regulatory requirements (data privacy, licensing, IP)

### **Pillar 3: SCALABILITY (The "Growth" Potential)**

**Definition:** Business has credible potential for meaningful growth, job creation, and expansion beyond local/UK markets.

**Endorsers Ask:**
- ✓ How will you grow from "first customers" to "significant player"?
- ✓ What does success look like in Year 1, 3, 5?
- ✓ How many jobs will you create?
- ✓ Can you expand nationally/internationally?
- ✓ Are there structural barriers to scaling (e.g., regulatory caps, supply constraints)?

**Evidence That Wins:**
- Realistic growth milestones with specific metrics (revenue, headcount, customer numbers)
- Phased plan: MVP → product-market fit → scale-up → expansion
- Job creation timeline (e.g., "2-3 hires in Year 1, 8-10 in Year 3")
- Geographic expansion strategy (UK regions, then Europe, then global)
- Repeatable business model (not dependent on founder's time alone)
- Market size analysis showing headroom for growth
- Partnerships/channels for scaling (e.g., integrations, reseller agreements)
- Evidence of network effects or viral potential (if applicable)

**Red Flags:**
- "Our market is huge, so we'll capture 1% and make millions" (oversimplified)
- Plan focused only on Year 1; no 3-5 year vision
- Founder must be involved in every customer interaction (not scalable)
- No thought on how you'd manage rapid growth
- Assumes exponential growth with no evidence or comparison
- Limited to UK market with no international potential

### **Pillar 4: FOUNDER CREDIBILITY (The "Trust" Factor)**

**Definition:** You have the skills, experience, commitment, and character to lead this venture successfully.

**Endorsers Ask:**
- ✓ What's your track record? (Previous businesses, relevant roles)
- ✓ Do you have relevant expertise for this venture?
- ✓ Are you genuinely committed? (Personal capital invested, full-time focus)
- ✓ Is your background clean? (No criminal/regulatory issues)
- ✓ Can you communicate clearly and professionally?

**Evidence That Wins:**
- Previous startup/entrepreneurial experience (even failed ventures if lessons learned)
- 5-10+ years in relevant industry or technical domain
- Clear articulation of vision and strategy
- Track record of delivery (e.g., past projects, promotions, results)
- Personal capital invested in business (shows skin in game)
- Strong co-founder/team with complementary skills
- Professional presentation (clear communication, attention to detail)
- References from investors, customers, or previous employers
- Thought leadership (articles, speaking, community involvement)

**Red Flags:**
- First-time founder with no business experience
- No personal capital invested (asks endorser to fund idea entirely)
- Vague or inarticulate about vision
- Job hopping every 1-2 years (suggests instability)
- Criminal record or regulatory issues
- Weak co-founder team (e.g., two marketers, no technical person for tech product)
- Plan written by consultant; founder's personal contribution unclear

# PART C: KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAILORING YOUR BUSINESS IDEA FOR THE APPLICATION

## C1: Strategic Positioning Framework

Your business idea must be positioned to **maximize endorser confidence** across all four pillars. Here's how:

### **C1.1: Positioning for Innovation**

**Your Goal:** Prove you're not copying someone else; you're solving a real problem better.

**Tactics:**

1. **Define Your Competitive Moat**
   - What makes you defensible vs. direct competitors?
   - Options: Proprietary tech, IP (patents/trade secrets), brand, network effects, data advantage, unique partnerships
   - Be specific: "Our algorithm is 40% faster due to [proprietary approach]" beats "Our product is innovative"

2. **Market Validation Before Application**
   - Conduct customer interviews (10-20 potential customers)
   - Document: "Customers said X," "They currently pay $Y," "They'd adopt if..."
   - Get LOIs from early customers (even if non-binding)
   - Run MVP/pilot and collect feedback
   - Endorsers value evidence you've validated demand

3. **Articulate Your Unique Angle**
   - Industry-specific (e.g., "We're building supply chain AI for pharma, not generic logistics")
   - Business model twist (e.g., "Marketplace where customers pay for premium services, not ads")
   - Geographic/demographic (e.g., "Solving fintech for Africa, not developed markets")
   - The more specific, the more credible

4. **Benchmark Against Competitors**
   - Create a competitive matrix: How do you compare on price, features, service, speed, compliance, etc.?
   - Show your advantage is real and material, not marginal

5. **If Pivoting or Iterating**
   - Explain why (e.g., "Customer research showed demand for B, not A")
   - Show learning and adaptation as strength, not weakness
   - Frame as "informed iteration," not "changing direction"

### **C1.2: Positioning for Viability**

**Your Goal:** Prove you've thought through details and can execute.

**Tactics:**

1. **Build Detailed Financial Models**
   - 3-year P&L with monthly granularity for Year 1, quarterly for Years 2-3
   - Cost breakdown:
     - Product development (team, tools, infrastructure)
     - Go-to-market (marketing, sales, partnerships)
     - Operations (legal, finance, HR, facilities)
     - Contingency (15-20% buffer)
   - Revenue assumptions based on:
     - Customer acquisition plan (channels, cost per customer, conversion rate)
     - Pricing strategy (justified vs. market comparables)
     - Unit economics (lifetime value, payback period, gross margin)
   - Clearly state all assumptions so endorser can assess realism

2. **Show Runway & Funding Story**
   - How much capital do you need? (Total, deployment timeline)
   - Where's it coming from? (Your savings, investors, grants)
   - How long will it last? (Burn rate, path to profitability)
   - What if you raise less? (Contingency plan)
   - Endorsers want to see you've thought about financing risks

3. **Demonstrate Operational Readiness**
   - Have you registered a company? (Even if not trading yet, shows commitment)
   - Regulatory roadmap: Licenses, compliance, data protection, IP, tax structure?
   - Go-to-market strategy: How will you acquire first customers? (B2B: direct sales? B2C: paid ads? Partnerships?)
   - Team/hiring plan: Who's in place? Who's critical to hire first?

4. **Evidence of Execution Ability**
   - Past business/project success (even small)
   - Portfolio of work or case studies
   - References from past employers/investors
   - Clear team with no critical gaps
   - Endorsers believe you can deliver based on track record

5. **Address Risks Proactively**
   - Don't bury risks; surface them first
   - For each major risk, explain mitigation
   - Example: "If customer acquisition is slower than plan, we'll pivot to partnerships with [X companies] who have pre-existing distribution"
   - Shows mature thinking

### **C1.3: Positioning for Scalability**

**Your Goal:** Prove growth isn't just possible—it's inevitable if you execute.

**Tactics:**

1. **Paint a 3-5 Year Growth Picture**
   - **Year 1:** MVP, first 10-50 customers, product-market fit validation, team of 2-4
   - **Year 2:** Scale product, expand to 100-500 customers, grow team to 8-12
   - **Year 3:** National expansion or new product line, 1000+ customers, team of 15-25
   - **Years 4-5:** Regional/international expansion or M&A
   - Numbers should flow from your unit economics (CAC, LTV, conversion rates)

2. **Job Creation Narrative**
   - Endorsers love UK job creation (government priority)
   - Document: "Year 1: 2 engineers; Year 2: add 5 more + 2 sales/marketing; Year 3: add 8 operations/support"
   - Explain: Where will these hires be? (UK cities/regions?)

3. **Market Size & TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
   - What's the total opportunity? (e.g., "UK SaaS market for supply chain = £5B")
   - What's your realistic capture? (Not 50% of TAM; be humble—1-2% credible)
   - Show you're not fighting for scraps

4. **Repeatable Unit Model**
   - Can you sell to customer 2, 100, 1000 without founder's 1-on-1 effort?
   - Describe the repeatable process (sales funnel, product/service delivery, customer success)
   - For B2B: Case studies or customer testimonials (ideally from pilot/MVP)
   - For B2C: Show viral potential or scalable acquisition channel

5. **Partnership/Distribution Strategy**
   - Partnerships that accelerate growth (e.g., integrations with complementary platforms)
   - Strategic relationships (e.g., channel partners, OEM deals)
   - Network effects (if applicable—does the product get better as more users join?)
   - Don't assume organic growth alone

### **C1.4: Positioning for Founder Credibility**

**Your Goal:** Make endorsers believe you'll see this through.

**Tactics:**

1. **Tell Your Founder Story Authentically**
   - Why are you solving this problem? (Personal experience? Industry frustration? Market gap you spotted?)
   - What's your track record? (Jobs, businesses, projects)
   - Why now? (Why launch this specific venture at this specific time?)
   - Founder narrative matters—make it compelling but honest

2. **Highlight Relevant Expertise**
   - Industry domain knowledge (10+ years in adjacent industry is strong)
   - Technical expertise (if relevant; co-founder/team can fill gaps)
   - Entrepreneurial experience (previous startup, even if failed, shows learning)
   - Customer access/relationships (can you get early customers?)

3. **Prove Commitment**
   - Personal capital invested (even £10-20k shows skin in game)
   - Full-time focus (not side project while employed elsewhere)
   - Team assembled (or clear hiring plan if solo founder)
   - Already working on MVP/early traction

4. **Build Trust Through Transparency**
   - Be honest about gaps (e.g., "I'm strong in product, hiring sales person for go-to-market")
   - Address past failures candidly (what did you learn?)
   - Be consistent across all documents (business plan, CV, application)
   - Endorsers will find inconsistencies; better you disclose first

5. **Demonstrate Communication Skills**
   - Business plan is clearly written (no jargon, concrete examples)
   - Pitch deck is visual and compelling
   - Presentation is polished (spelling, grammar, design matter)
   - You can articulate vision confidently in pitch

## C2: Selecting the Right Endorsing Body

**Critical:** Each endorsing body has sector focus, assessment style, and criteria nuances.

### **Endorsing Body Profiles (as of Jan 2026):**

| Body | Sector Focus | Style | Good For |
|------|--------------|-------|----------|
| **Envestors Limited** | Tech, fintech, digital | Investor-backed, pitch-focused | Tech founders with investor track record |
| **UK Endorsing Services** | Broad (all sectors) | Balanced, thorough due diligence | Diverse ideas, non-tech innovation |
| **Innovator International** | Tech, innovation | Global founder focus | International founders with tech ideas |
| **Global Entrepreneurs Programme (GEP)** | Tech, innovation, some deep-tech | Accelerator model | Startup ecosystem experience preferred |

### **Selecting Your Endorser:**
1. **Match sector:** Choose body with experience in your industry
2. **Research their requirements:** Each publishes guidance—follow it meticulously
3. **Review success stories:** What types of businesses do they endorse? (On their website)
4. **Assess fit:** Do you align with their thesis/focus?
5. **Application:** Submit strong initial proposal to best-fit body (prioritize one to avoid splitting attention)

---

# PART D: COMPONENTS OF A WINNING BUSINESS PROPOSAL

## D1: Essential Elements of the Business Plan Document

Your **business plan is the core document**. It must be comprehensive, professional, and evidence-based. Here's the structure:

### **1. Executive Summary (1-2 pages)**
**Purpose:** Hook the endorser in 2 minutes. They'll decide whether to read the full plan based on this.

**Must Include:**
- Business concept in one sentence (the "hook")
- Problem you're solving (specific, not vague)
- Your solution (what's unique about it?)
- Target market (who, how many, how much they'll pay)
- Go-to-market strategy (how you'll reach customers)
- Financial summary: Revenue Year 1/2/3, profitability timeline, funding needed
- Team (founders, key expertise)
- Why now? (Market/timing opportunity)

**Tone:** Confident, clear, compelling without hype.

**Example (BAD):**
"We're building a platform for people to connect online."

**Example (GOOD):**
"We're building an AI-powered supply chain risk management platform for pharmaceutical manufacturers in the UK. The market loses £2.5B annually to supply chain disruptions. Our ML model predicts disruptions 30 days in advance with 94% accuracy (validated with 3 pharma customers). Target customers pay £50-200k annually. We'll reach £200k MRR by Year 2 and 150+ jobs by Year 5."

---

### **2. Problem Definition & Market Opportunity (2-3 pages)**

**Purpose:** Convince endorser the problem is real and valuable.

**Include:**
- **Problem:** Specific pain point (not theoretical—evidence-based)
  - Customer quotes: "Our current system costs us £X and fails Y times per year"
  - Industry data: "Market loses £Z annually to this problem"
  - Why current solutions fail (competitive analysis)
- **Market Size:** TAM (Total Addressable Market)
  - Example: "UK pharma supply chain management market = £5B; our niche = £300M"
  - Show your calc: (# of potential customers) × (annual spend per customer)
- **Customer Profile:** Detailed persona
  - Who? (Title, company size, industry)
  - What are they currently doing? (Status quo)
  - Why current solution sucks (cost, reliability, ease-of-use)
  - How much do they spend today?
- **Market Validation:**
  - Customer interviews (10-20 interviews summarized)
  - Survey results
  - LOIs or pilot commitments
  - Competitive landscape (who else is trying to solve this, and why aren't they winning?)

---

### **3. Solution & Product Overview (2-3 pages)**

**Purpose:** Prove your solution is better and unique.

**Include:**
- **What You're Building:** Detailed description
  - Core product/service offering
  - Key features (prioritize top 3-5)
  - How it solves the problem uniquely
  - MVP/prototype status (launched, beta, in development?)
- **Competitive Differentiation:**
  - Direct competitors and how you're different
  - Feature comparison table (your product vs. top 3 competitors)
  - Your defensible advantage (IP, data, network effects, brand, speed?)
  - Why competitors can't easily replicate
- **Product Roadmap (Next 12-18 months):**
  - MVP complete: when?
  - Beta launch: when, with which customers?
  - Version 2.0 features: when?
  - International or new product lines: timing?
- **Intellectual Property:**
  - Patents filed or planned?
  - Trade secrets or proprietary algorithms?
  - Brand/trademark strategy?

---

### **4. Business Model & Unit Economics (2-3 pages)**

**Purpose:** Show how you'll make money sustainably.

**Include:**
- **Revenue Model:**
  - How do customers pay? (Subscription, one-time, usage-based, commission?)
  - Pricing strategy (per seat, per transaction, per month?)
  - Justify pricing: "Customers currently pay £X for inferior solution; we're 30% cheaper and 2x better"
  - Willingness to pay (evidence from surveys/LOIs)
- **Unit Economics:**
  - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): How much to get one customer? (Marketing spend ÷ customers acquired)
  - Lifetime Value (LTV): How much profit over customer lifetime? (Annual revenue per customer × gross margin × years retained)
  - Payback Period: How many months to recover CAC? (CAC ÷ monthly gross profit)
  - Rule of thumb: LTV should be 3x CAC; payback <12 months
  - Example: "CAC £2k, LTV £15k, payback 4 months" = healthy model
- **Revenue Forecast (3-year detail):**
  - Year 1: # customers, avg revenue per customer, total revenue
  - Year 2-3: similar breakdown with growth assumptions
  - Example:
    - Y1: 20 customers × £60k = £1.2M
    - Y2: 100 customers × £75k = £7.5M (growth via sales team)
    - Y3: 250 customers × £85k = £21.25M (product-market fit, scaling)
  - Clearly state assumptions (churn rate, ASP growth, etc.)
- **Cost Structure:**
  - Product development: Salaries, tools, infrastructure
  - Go-to-market: Sales, marketing, partnerships
  - Operations: Legal, finance, HR, admin
  - COGS (if applicable): Hosting, third-party services
  - Example:

                          CONCEPT NOTE
           [Business Name]: [Tagline/One-liner]

1. THE BIG IDEA (½ page)

[Tell your founder story in 1-2 compelling paragraphs. Why are YOU solving this problem?]

Example:
"During my 10 years in pharmaceutical supply chain management at GSK, I witnessed how supply chain disruptions cost the company £2M+ annually. These disruptions were often predictable—yet our manual processes, legacy systems, and siloed data meant we discovered problems only after they happened. I met John (PhD machine learning) at a conference, and we realized that applying modern AI to pharma-specific supply chain data could predict and prevent 40%+ of disruptions.

That insight—combined with our domain expertise, market validation from 3 paid pilots, and a clear path to 40%+ gross margins—led us to found [Company]. We're here to build the best supply chain risk intelligence platform for pharmaceutical manufacturers."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2. THE PROBLEM (½ page)

[What's broken? Why now?]

"Pharmaceutical manufacturers face increasing supply chain complexity: geopolitical risks, supplier quality issues, regulatory changes, logistics disruptions. Current solutions are:
- Manual (rely on human monitoring, prone to human error)
- Slow (discover problems after they've impacted production)
- Siloed (don't integrate data from all risk sources)
- Generic (don't account for pharma-specific compliance/regulatory needs)

Result: Industry-wide losses of £2.5B+ annually due to preventable disruptions."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. THE SOLUTION (½ page)

[What do you offer? Why is it different?]

"[Company] provides AI-powered supply chain risk management for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our platform:
- Predicts supply chain disruptions 30+ days in advance (94% accuracy, validated with pilots)
- Combines regulatory, geopolitical, quality, and logistics data into a single risk score
- Provides actionable early warnings to procurement and supply chain teams
- Integrates with existing systems (SAP, Oracle, etc.)

Unique advantage: We combine deep pharma domain expertise (our founders) with advanced machine learning to solve the actual needs of pharma companies—not generic supply chain platforms."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4. MARKET & BUSINESS MODEL (½ page)

"Target Market: Pharmaceutical manufacturers in UK and globally.
- 250+ UK manufacturers with £50-200k annual budget for supply chain risk tools
- UK TAM: £300M; Global TAM: £5B+

Revenue Model: SaaS subscription
- Price: £60-200k/year depending on company size and number of suppliers
- Unit economics: £2k CAC, £15k LTV, 3:1 ratio, 4-month payback

- Year 1: 20 customers → £1.2M revenue
- Year 2: 100 customers → £7.5M revenue
- Year 3: 250 customers → £21M+ revenue
- Path to profitability: Month 18"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5. TRACTION & VALIDATION (½ page)

"To date:
- ✓ 3 pilot customers (pharma SMEs and large corporates): All paid, all showing >80% feature adoption
- ✓ Market validation: 15+ customer interviews confirming problem severity and willingness to pay
- ✓ MVP launched: AI model trained on 10k+ supply chain incident records; 94% prediction accuracy

# PART H: AI AGENT DELIBERATION STRUCTURE

Now that you have research and templates, here's how to structure deliberation among your AI agent team at **BMAD METHOD**:

## H1: AI Agent Roles & Deliberation Flow

### **Agent 1: Market Research Agent**
**Role:** Validate market assumptions and identify data gaps

**Questions to Deliberate:**
- Is the TAM calculation accurate? (Compare to industry reports, analyst coverage)
- Is customer willingness to pay realistic? (Check against pricing of comparable solutions)
- Are there market headwinds we haven't surfaced? (Regulatory changes, competitive threats)
- Is the timing right? (Market adoption curves, technology readiness)

**Output:** Market validation memo confirming or challenging assumptions

### **Agent 2: Financial Analysis Agent**
**Role:** Stress-test unit economics and financial projections

**Questions to Deliberate:**
- Are customer acquisition costs realistic? (Benchmark against industry)
- Is LTV reasonable? (Retention assumptions, expansion revenue)
- Do profitability timelines make sense? (Gross margin assumptions, OpEx scalability)
- Is funding request justified? (Deployment timeline, contingencies)

**Output:** Financial health assessment; flags on risky assumptions

### **Agent 3: Competitive Intelligence Agent**
**Role:** Assess differentiation and defensibility

**Questions to Deliberate:**
- Is the innovation claim credible? (Real differentiation or me-too with hype?)
- Who are the actual competitors? (Direct, indirect, potential new entrants)
- How defensible is the moat? (IP strength, switching costs, network effects)
- What's the competitive response risk? (Can incumbents easily copy? Will they?)

**Output:** Competitive positioning assessment

### **Agent 4: Execution Feasibility Agent**
**Role:** Evaluate team capability and execution risk

**Questions to Deliberate:**
- Do founders have relevant expertise? (Track record in domain? Startup experience?)
- Are there critical team gaps? (Technical? Sales? Operations?)
- Is the hiring plan realistic? (Timeline, compensation, market availability)
- What are execution risks? (Dependencies, burn rate, key person risk)

**Output:** Team & execution health assessment

### **Agent 5: Regulatory/Compliance Agent** (if applicable)
**Role:** Identify regulatory risks and compliance gaps

**Questions to Deliberate:**
- What licenses/certifications are required? (Data protection, industry-specific, etc.)
- Is the compliance roadmap realistic? (Timeline, cost, feasibility)
- Are there regulatory headwinds? (Coming changes, geographic restrictions)
- Is IP strategy sound? (Patents enforceable? Trademarks protected?)

**Output:** Regulatory risk assessment

### **Agent 6: Integration & Coherence Agent**
**Role:** Ensure all pieces fit together; identify internal contradictions

**Questions to Deliberate:**
- Do financial projections align with market opportunity? (Is upside credible but not moonshot?)
- Does GTM strategy support revenue forecast? (CAC assumptions match strategy?)
- Are team capabilities aligned with execution plan? (Can they deliver the roadmap?)
- Are risks identified and mitigated? (No fatal flaws?)

**Output:** Coherence check; overall feasibility assessment

---

## H2: Deliberation Process (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Information Sharing (Agent Alignment)**
- All agents receive: Business proposal draft, concept note, financial model, customer evidence
- Each agent prepares initial assessment in their domain

**Output per agent:** 1-2 page assessment of what's strong, what's weak, what's missing

### **Step 2: Cross-Agent Dialogue**
Agents challenge each other's assumptions:

**Example Dialogue:**
- **Market Agent:** "TAM of £300M assumes 80% of manufacturers will adopt. That's aggressive; realistic is 20-30%."
- **Financial Agent:** "If we use 25% adoption, TAM drops to £75M. That changes Year 3 revenue from £21M to £5M. Are we still viable?"
- **Execution Agent:** "At £5M revenue, we'd have 15-20 employees. That's still healthy margins. But we need to slow hiring in Year 2 and focus on CAC reduction."
- **Competitive Agent:** "If revenue is lower, bigger players might enter. But we'd still have first-mover advantage and customer lock-in via integrations."

**Outcome:** Refined assumptions, risk register updated

### **Step 3: Consensus Building**
Agents agree on:
- What assumptions are solid (high confidence)
- What assumptions are risky (low confidence, need validation)
- What's missing (data gaps, validation needed)
- Critical next steps

**Output:** Consensus memo on viability, key assumptions, and critical risks

### **Step 4: Recommendations to Founder**
Agents provide actionable feedback:
- **Do this before applying:** Strengthen market evidence, resolve financial contradictions, hire key person
- **Nice to have:** Expand partnership roadmap, build IP moat
- **Watch out for:** Over-optimistic CAC assumptions, team gap in [domain]
