# UK INNOVATOR FOUNDER VISA: FOCUSED BRIEFING FOR AI AGENTS & MENTOR DISCUSSIONS
**Version:** 2.0 (Condensed for Agent Action)  
**Purpose:** Enable AI agents + founder to research, validate, and develop visa application artifacts  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks of collaborative agent-founder deliberation

---

## CONTEXT FOR YOUR AGENTS

You are supporting the founder in preparing for a **UK Innovator Founder Visa application**. This visa requires:
- **Endorsement from a Home Office-approved body** (70 points threshold)
- **Proof of:** Innovation, Viability, Scalability, Founder Credibility
- **Timeline:** Endorsement (4-8 weeks) → Visa application (8 weeks)

**Your goal:** Help founder strengthen business idea across 4 critical dimensions before approaching endorsers.

---

## PART 1: WHAT ENDORSERS ASSESS (The 4 Pillars)

### **1. INNOVATION**
**Definition:** Genuine newness; solves real problem better than alternatives.

**Endorsers verify:**
- ✓ Is there customer demand? (LOIs, pilot data, interviews—not opinion)
- ✓ What's the competitive moat? (IP, tech, speed, data, network effects)
- ✓ Can competitors easily copy this? (Defensibility)

**Red flag:** "Another [generic] platform" → Must prove unique differentiation

---

### **2. VIABILITY**
**Definition:** Realistic execution plan with credible team & financials.

**Endorsers verify:**
- ✓ Financial projections grounded in reality? (Unit economics: CAC, LTV, payback)
- ✓ Management team has relevant expertise? (Domain knowledge, past wins, commitment)
- ✓ Clear operational roadmap? (Regulations, compliance, tech stack, supply chain)

**Red flag:** "We'll be profitable in 6 months" with no cost breakdown → Lacks rigor

---

### **3. SCALABILITY**
**Definition:** Credible path to significant growth (jobs, revenue, geography).

**Endorsers verify:**
- ✓ How do you grow from 1 customer to 100? (Repeatable model, not founder-dependent)
- ✓ Job creation plan? (Hiring timeline, UK regions)
- ✓ 3-5 year milestones realistic? (Not moonshot, evidence-based)

**Red flag:** "We'll dominate global market in 2 years" → Unrealistic, no roadmap

---

### **4. FOUNDER CREDIBILITY**
**Definition:** You have skills, track record, and genuine commitment to execute.

**Endorsers verify:**
- ✓ Domain expertise? (5+ years relevant experience OR co-founder compensates)
- ✓ Track record? (Previous startup, projects, growth, learning from failure)
- ✓ Commitment? (Personal capital invested, full-time focus, team capability)

**Red flag:** First-time founder with no capital at risk → Low confidence in follow-through

---

## PART 2: KEY QUESTIONS FOR YOUR AGENTS TO EXPLORE WITH FOUNDER

### **BEFORE YOU START AGENT DELIBERATION:**
Use BMAD's **Brainstorming Workflow** to deep-dive on these topics.

#### **On Innovation & Market Fit**
- Q1: What specific customer pain point does your solution solve? (Be precise—"supply chain disruptions in pharma" not "helping businesses")
- Q2: What evidence do you have that customers will pay for this? (LOIs, interviews, pilot revenue—not just surveys)
- Q3: Who are your 3-5 direct competitors? How are you different? (Feature table, pricing, approach)
- Q4: What would stop a well-funded competitor from copying you in 12 months?
- Q5: Do you have or plan IP (patents, trade secrets, data advantage, network effects)?

#### **On Viability & Team**
- Q6: What's your relevant domain experience? (Years, companies, roles, quantified wins)
- Q7: What's missing from your current team? (Technical? Sales? Operations? How will you hire?)
- Q8: How much of your own capital are you investing? (Shows commitment; endorsers care about skin in game)
- Q9: What regulatory/compliance requirements does your business have? (Timeline, budget, risk?)
- Q10: Build your unit economics: What does it cost to acquire 1 customer? How much do they pay? When do you break even?

#### **On Scalability & Growth**
- Q11: Draw a 3-year picture: Year 1 [X customers, £Y revenue], Year 2, Year 3. What drives growth each year?
- Q12: How do you move from manual work (founder-driven) to scalable/repeatable? (Process, product, automation?)
- Q13: What's your job creation plan? (How many hires each year? What roles?)
- Q14: Can you expand geographically? (UK → Europe → Global? Or stuck to niche?)

#### **On Funding & Resources**
- Q15: How much capital do you need to reach profitability? (What's it spent on?)
- Q16: Do you have access to that funding? (Savings, investors, grants? Proof?)
- Q17: What happens if funding is delayed or market adoption is 50% slower?

---

## PART 4: QUESTIONS FOR FOUNDER TO ANSWER NOW

**Help your agents assess realistically:**

1. **Your Business Idea:** 1-2 sentence description. What problem? Who benefits? Why unique?

2. **Stage:** (Concept / MVP in development / Beta launched / Early revenue?)

3. **Your Background:** 
   - Years in this domain? Relevant companies/roles?
   - Previous startup/business experience?
   - Co-founder? What's their expertise?

4. **Market Evidence:**
   - Have you spoken to potential customers? How many? What did they say?
   - Do you have LOIs or pilot commitments?
   - Early revenue? (Amount and source?)

5. **Technology:**
   - Are you the full-stack developer? (What can you build, what do you need help with?)
   - Do you need a machine learning expert? (Yes/No? How will you get one?)
   - What's your tech stack / infrastructure plan?

6. **Capital & Resources:**
   - How much have you invested personally? (£? From savings, family, prior business?)
   - How much do you need to reach first major milestone? (MVP, 10 customers, profitability?)
   - Do you have access to that? (Investors, grants, savings?)

7. **Ambition:**
   - Where do you see this in 5 years? (Revenue? Employees? Geographic reach?)
   - Is this UK-focused or global?
   - Would you stay in UK if visa granted, or expand elsewhere?

---

## PART 5: INSTITUTIONAL BACKING & STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS

**Your situation:** B2G (Business-to-Government) venture, no institutional backing yet, fullstack developer (no ML expertise).

### **Agents should explore:**

**1. Finding Strategic Partners (Instead of or alongside investors)**
- Government innovation programs (Innovate UK grants, tech accelerators)
- Academic research partnerships (UK universities with ML/AI research arms)
- Industry bodies / consortiums (If sector-specific)
- Tech consultancies (For ML expertise on revenue-share or equity basis)

**2. Building a Compelling IP Story**
- If relying on external ML experts: How do you own the IP? (Co-founder equity splits, licensing agreements)
- Patent strategy: What will you protect? What's trade secrets?
- First-mover advantage: Can you establish defensibility before well-funded competitors enter?

**3. Go-to-Market Without Large Capital**
- B2G means you need government contracts/tenders → Different sales motion than B2B/B2C
- Can you pilot with 1-2 government departments on a low-cost basis?
- Government procurement typically slower but more valuable per deal

---

## PART 6: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE & WINNING STRATEGY

**You're right to think ahead on competitors.** Here's the framework:

### **For Your Agents to Research:**

1. **Direct Competitors:** Who's solving the exact same problem? (List 3-5)
   - How big are they? (Funding, customers, revenue)
   - What's their advantage? (Established relationships, better tech, cheaper?)
   - What's their weakness? (Slow, expensive, inflexible, focused elsewhere?)
   - How do you differentiate? (Speed? Cost? Compliance? Better UX? Domain expertise?)

2. **Indirect Competitors:** Who's solving adjacent problems?
   - Example: If you're in crisis communication, competitors might be traditional PR firms, general alerting platforms, emergency management software
   - How do they compare on your dimensions?

3. **Your Competitive Advantage (Pick 2-3, be specific):**
   - **Domain expertise:** You understand gov/civic sector better than tech platforms
   - **Speed:** Faster deployment/iteration than enterprise vendors
   - **Cost:** Cheaper than legacy solutions
   - **Compliance:** Built for UK regulation/data protection from ground up
   - **User experience:** Simpler, more intuitive
   - **Proprietary tech:** ML model, algorithm, data
   - **Network effects:** Better as more agencies use it
   - **Speed to market:** First mover in specific niche

4. **Measuring Success (Against Competitors):**
   - Retention rate (% of customers renewing/expanding)
   - Time to value (days to get first result)
   - Cost per agency per year (vs. competitor pricing)
   - Feature completeness vs. competitors (matrix)
   - Customer satisfaction / NPS
   - Expansion revenue (upsells to existing customers)

## PART 7: AGENT TASKS & WORKFLOWS TO USE

### **Recommended BMAD Workflows:**

1. **Brainstorming Workflow** (for deep market exploration)
   - Use "Five W's" technique for problem definition

   - Competitive benchmarking

3. **Financial Modeling Workflow** (if available)
   - Unit economics
   - Scenario planning (best/base/worst case)
   - Profitability runway

4. **Custom Deliberation (Your agents should do this)**
   - **Market Research Agent:** Challenge TAM, validate customer evidence
   - **Financial Agent:** Stress-test unit economics, verify profitability timeline
   - **Competitive Agent:** Assess moat strength, defensibility, response risk
   - **Execution Agent:** Audit team capability, execution risk, hiring plan

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**Endorsers will reject your application if:**
- ❌ No customer evidence (LOIs, pilots, interviews)
- ❌ Financials don't add up (CAC too high, LTV unclear, margins unrealistic)
- ❌ Me-too idea with weak differentiation
- ❌ Founder team has critical gaps and no hiring plan
- ❌ Projections are moonshot (100x growth in 2 years with no evidence)
- ❌ No understanding of regulatory requirements

**Endorsers will endorse if:**
- ✅ Customer evidence is strong (paid pilots, LOIs, repeating demand)
- ✅ Financials are realistic with clear assumptions
- ✅ Innovation is credible and defensible
- ✅ Team has relevant expertise or clear hiring plan
- ✅ Projections are ambitious but achievable (benchmarked to similar companies)
- ✅ Founder shows deep commitment (personal capital, full-time focus)
