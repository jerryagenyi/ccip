# Epic 008: Pattern Database

## Epic Goal
Implement the foundational pattern database for storing, searching, and validating semiotic patterns that power the CCIP intelligence system. This is the core data foundation that enables semiotic risk assessment and continuous learning from field operations.

## Epic Description
This epic provides the pattern database infrastructure that powers CCIP's intelligence. Patterns represent communication failures and successes across different cultural contexts. The system supports pattern storage, search, validation, and effectiveness tracking. Patterns can be organization-specific or globally shared.

## Key Features
- Pattern storage with rich context metadata
- Full-text and vector similarity search
- Pattern validation workflow
- Effectiveness tracking from field reports
- Performance optimized (< 500ms search)
- Support for 10,000+ patterns

## Priority
**Critical** - Foundation for Intelligence

## Dependencies
- Epic 001: User & Organisation Management

## Status
Ready for implementation
